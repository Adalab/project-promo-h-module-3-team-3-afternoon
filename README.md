# Awesome Profile Cards.
![APC2-home](APC-home.png)
This is another of our projects at [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). It is a simple app that allows the user to create a digital business card with their full name, position and links to their contact details and social network profiles.
We are a team of four students and we had to migrate a vanilla javascript version of the app to React. One of the key features we had to achieve was to connect to a third party API to store the user's data and create the link to the card.
[This](https://us-central1-awesome-cards-cf6f0.cloudfunctions.net/card/-LxBP-zwF7FL9GtaPOuF) is an example of a business card created with our app. [Why not create yours as well?!](http://beta.adalab.es/project-promo-h-module-3-team-3-afternoon/)
